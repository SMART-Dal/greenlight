2023-12-09 13:50:59.990914: W tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_bfc_allocator.cc:39] Overriding allow_growth setting because the TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH environment variable is set. Original config value was 0.
WARNING:tensorflow:Using temporary folder as model directory: /tmp/tmpyw5e20d2
WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/saurabh/miniconda3/envs/tf2/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tensorflow/python/training/training_util.py:400: Variable.initialized_value (from tensorflow.python.ops.variables) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use Variable.read_value. Variables in 2.X are initialized automatically both in eager and graph (inside tf.defun) contexts.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/saurabh/miniconda3/envs/tf2/lib/python3.9/site-packages/keras/optimizer_v2/adagrad.py:83: calling Constant.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.init_ops) with dtype is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Call initializer instance with the dtype argument instead of passing it to the constructor
