WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/saurabh/miniconda3/envs/tf2/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tensorflow/python/training/training_util.py:400: Variable.initialized_value (from tensorflow.python.ops.variables) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use Variable.read_value. Variables in 2.X are initialized automatically both in eager and graph (inside tf.defun) contexts.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/saurabh/miniconda3/envs/tf2/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tensorflow/python/training/adagrad.py:142: calling Constant.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.init_ops) with dtype is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Call initializer instance with the dtype argument instead of passing it to the constructor
