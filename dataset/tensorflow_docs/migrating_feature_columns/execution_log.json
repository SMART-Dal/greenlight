2023-12-09 07:36:38.154519: W tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_bfc_allocator.cc:39] Overriding allow_growth setting because the TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH environment variable is set. Original config value was 0.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/saurabh/miniconda3/envs/tf2/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tensorflow/python/feature_column/feature_column_v2.py:4202: sparse_merge (from tensorflow.python.ops.sparse_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
No similar op available at this time.

Instructions for updating:
Use Variable.read_value. Variables in 2.X are initialized automatically both in eager and graph (inside tf.defun) contexts.
